# CS50 C Solutions
Welcome to my repository of solutions for CS50, covering problem sets 1 through 5. These solutions are written in C, following the problem specifications provided by the course.

You might notice a mix of naming conventions in the code:

`CS50 uses snake_case, where words are separated by underscores (e.g., get_int, check_valid).`

`I prefer camelCase, where each word is capitalized except for the first (e.g., getInt, checkValid).`

As a result, some files follow CS50's snake_case naming style, while others follow my personal camelCase preference. Generally, files provided by CS50 with partial implementations retain their original naming convention, while files written from scratch use camelCase.

The same can be said about comments. I mostly dislike comments where they aren't needed, but since files provided by CS50 have _a lot_ of comments, I just followed the convention provided.
